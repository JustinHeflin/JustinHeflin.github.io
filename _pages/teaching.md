Selected Student Comments:
- "Overall I think Justin is a wonderful professor and goes above and beyond for his students. He was always very helpful and made sure we understood the material"
- "Justin is a great professor. The content of the class could have been difficult, but he explained things in real life examples and in ways that were easy to understand. The activities used (i.e. candy for market structures, ball activity representing restaurant productivity, etc) were helpful for hands on learners. I really enjoyed how simple this class was in terms of no crazy powerpoints or things like that, it was just the professor and the whiteboard which was refreshing. Overall I have a very positive view on economics because of this class."
- "Heflin's class is fun, and he is easy to relate to. He applies each subject in the course into real life and is willing to explain everything further if needed."
- "I always had bad experiences with online classes, but this instructor made this a very enjoyable experience, with classes being able to be accessed week by week. I really liked how I had a scheduled time during my week to complete this class - it was a very good help when all of my classes became online, and I knew what to expect. Hefling was also great - I messed up a few times through the semester, and it was very easy to access him with him only being a message away. He always responded timely."
- "The professor uses a lot of examples when teaching, it makes the information become more of a reality and engaging rather than just learning it."
- "I believe that Professor Heflin was extremely helpful and creative in the way he presented the material. He made the class very comfortable and fostered a healthy learning environment."
- "Very interactive, he learned our names and included us in examples. Never made me feel bad about having a question."
- "I think how personable and relatable the instructor made the course really helped me learn. The instructor made me want to attend class more as it was engaging and interesting to learn about the topics."
