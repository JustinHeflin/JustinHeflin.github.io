Hello, and welcome to the site! I am a Lecturer at the University of Kentucky, and my focus is on microeconomics and public policy. Specifically, my research looks at the implementation of public policy such as Red Flag Laws, Execution Moratoriums, and Zero Dollar Bail. I also enjoy teaching, having experience not only from WVU but also Fairmont State University where I earned my bachelor's degree as well as my MBA. I received my PhD in Economics from West Virginia University in 2023. Most of my teaching experience is in microeconomics, econometrics, and law & economics.
